JSON examples and exercise
get familiar with packages for dealing with JSON
study examples with JSON strings and files
work on exercise to be completed and submitted

data source: http://jsonstudio.com/resources/


JSON exercise
Using data in file 'data/world_bank_projects.json' and the techniques demonstrated above,

Find the 10 countries with most projects
Find the top 10 major project themes (using column 'mjtheme_namecode')
In 2. above you will notice that some entries have only the code and the name is missing. Create a dataframe with the missing names filled in.

# APIMiniProject
Qaundl has a large number of data sources, but, unfortunately, most of them require a Premium subscription. Still, there are also a good number of free datasets.

For this mini project, we will focus on equities data from the Frankfurt Stock Exhange (FSE), which is available for free. We'll try and analyze the stock prices of a company called Carl Zeiss Meditec, which manufactures tools for eye examinations, as well as medical lasers for laser eye surgery: https://www.zeiss.com/meditec/int/home.html. The company is listed under the stock ticker AFX_X.

You can find the detailed Quandl API instructions here: https://docs.quandl.com/docs/time-series

While there is a dedicated Python package for connecting to the Quandl API, we would prefer that you use the requests package, which can be easily downloaded using pip or conda. You can find the documentation for the package here: http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/

Finally, apart from the requests package, you are encouraged to not use any third party Python packages, such as pandas, and instead focus on what's available in the Python Standard Library (the collections module might come in handy: https://pymotw.com/3/collections/). Also, since you won't have access to DataFrames, you are encouraged to us Python's native data structures - preferably dictionaries, though some questions can also be answered using lists. You can read more on these data structures here: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html

Keep in mind that the JSON responses you will be getting from the API map almost one-to-one to Python's dictionaries. Unfortunately, they can be very nested, so make sure you read up on indexing dictionaries in the documentation provided above.


# Mean Human Body Temperature mini project
What is the True Normal Human Body Temperature?
Background
The mean normal body temperature was held to be 37 ‚àò C or 98.6 ‚àò F for more than 120 years since it was first conceptualized and reported by Carl Wunderlich in a famous 1868 book. But, is this value statistically correct?


# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market
Background
Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical r√©sum√©s to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.

Data
In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.

Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer.


# Hospital Readmissions Data Analysis and Recommendations for Reduction
Background
In October 2012, the US government's Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) began reducing Medicare payments for Inpatient Prospective Payment System hospitals with excess readmissions. Excess readmissions are measured by a ratio, by dividing a hospital‚Äôs number of ‚Äúpredicted‚Äù 30-day readmissions for heart attack, heart failure, and pneumonia by the number that would be ‚Äúexpected,‚Äù based on an average hospital with similar patients. A ratio greater than 1 indicates excess readmissions.


# Linear Regression in Python
This is a very quick run-through of some basic statistical concepts, adapted from Lab 4 in Harvard's CS109 course. Please feel free to try the original lab if you're feeling ambitious :-) The CS109 git repository also has the solutions if you're stuck.

Linear Regression Models
Prediction using linear regression
Linear regression is used to model and predict continuous outcomes with normal random errors. There are nearly an infinite number of different types of regression models and each regression model is typically defined by the distribution of the prediction errors (called "residuals") of the type of data. Logistic regression is used to model binary outcomes whereas Poisson regression is used to predict counts. In this exercise, we'll see some examples of linear regression as well as Train-test splits.

The packages we'll cover are: statsmodels, seaborn, and scikit-learn. While we don't explicitly teach statsmodels and seaborn in the Springboard workshop, those are great libraries to know.

# Logistic Regress in Python
Classification
Note: We've adapted this Mini Project from Lab 5 in the CS109 course. Please feel free to check out the original lab, both for more exercises, as well as solutions.

We turn our attention to classification. Classification tries to predict, which of a small set of classes, an observation belongs to. Mathematically, the aim is to find  ùë¶ , a label based on knowing a feature vector  ùê± . For instance, consider predicting gender from seeing a person's face, something we do fairly well as humans. To have a machine do this well, we would typically feed the machine a bunch of images of people which have been labelled "male" or "female" (the training set), and have it learn the gender of the person in the image from the labels and the features used to determine gender. Then, given a new photo, the trained algorithm returns us the gender of the person in the photo.

There are different ways of making classifications. One idea is shown schematically in the image below, where we find a line that divides "things" of two different types in a 2-dimensional feature space. The classification show in the figure below is an example of a maximum-margin classifier where construct a decision boundary that is far as possible away from both classes of points. The fact that a line can be drawn to separate the two classes makes the problem linearly separable. Support Vector Machines (SVM) are an example of a maximum-margin classifier.


# Naive Bayes in Python
Basic Text Classification with Naive Bayes
In the mini-project, you'll learn the basics of text analysis using a subset of movie reviews from the rotten tomatoes database. You'll also use a fundamental technique in Bayesian inference, called Naive Bayes. This mini-project is based on Lab 10 of Harvard's CS109 class. Please free to go to the original lab for additional exercises and solutions.
